# Applications

This part of your application to ScottyLabs tests your ability to follow technical specifications and use GitHub. You'll need to create a TOML file showcasing your programming projects while adhering to our formatting standards and schema validation.

Your submission should include repositories that showcase your software engineering skills and proficiency across different tech stacks. The descriptions should be a sentence or two that elaborate on what each project is and mention any notable technical challenges.

## Requirements

1. Create a TOML file in `projects/` named `your-github-username.toml`.

2. Observe the required schema format in `meta/projects.schema.json`, and use the existing files in `projects/` as references. 

3. List your repositories using the required format.

4. Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard in your pull request title.

5. Ensure your file passes all CI checks, including EditorConfig compliance and TOML (schema) validation.
